# Enhanced Flight Weather Chart Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of an enhanced flight weather chart using Chart.js, inspired by React chart components but implemented in vanilla JavaScript for seamless integration with the existing Flask application.

## Features

### Enhanced Flight Weather Timeline Chart
- **Multi-axis visualization**: Displays visibility, temperature, dew point, and wind speed on separate Y-axes
- **Weather icons**: Shows weather condition icons above data points (☀️ sunny, 🌧️ rain, ⛈️ thunderstorms, 🌫️ haze/mist, 🌁 fog)
- **Interactive tooltips**: Detailed information on hover including location, wind direction/speed, weather conditions, and cloud information
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Real-time data**: Uses live weather data from your existing Flask backend

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
1. **`static/js/FlightWeatherChart.jsx`** - React component version (for reference)
2. **`static/js/flight-weather-chart.js`** - Vanilla JavaScript implementation
3. **`test_chart.html`** - Test page for chart functionality
4. **`CHART_INTEGRATION.md`** - This documentation file

### Modified Files
1. **`templates/index.html`**
   - Added Chart.js CDN link
   - Added new chart container section
   - Added script reference to flight-weather-chart.js

2. **`static/js/main.js`**
   - Added `createFlightWeatherChart()` function
   - Added `transformDataForFlightChart()` function
   - Integrated chart creation into the main data flow

## Usage

### Automatic Integration
The enhanced chart is automatically displayed when you analyze a flight plan:

1. Enter departure and arrival airports (e.g., KJFK → KLAX)
2. Add waypoints if desired (e.g., KORD, KDEN)
3. Click "Get Route Briefing"
4. The enhanced chart appears above the existing weather timeline

### Manual Testing
You can test the chart independently by opening `test_chart.html` in your browser.

## Data Format

The chart expects data in the following format:

```javascript
{
    timeline: [
        {
            start_time: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
            location_description: "KJFK - John F Kennedy Intl",
            visibility: 8,
            temperature: 12,
            wind_speed: 15,
            weather_description: "Light rain",
            cloud_description: "Overcast",
            conditions: {
                natural_language: "Weather: Light rain. Clouds: Overcast..."
            }
        }
        // ... more timeline entries
    ]
}
```

## Chart Configuration

### Datasets
1. **Visibility (SM)** - Blue line, left Y-axis
2. **Temperature (°C)** - Red line, right Y-axis  
3. **Dew Point (°C)** - Green dashed line, right Y-axis
4. **Wind Speed (kt)** - Yellow dashed line, right Y-axis

### Weather Icons
- ☀️ Clear/Sunny conditions
- 🌧️ Rain/Precipitation
- ⛈️ Thunderstorms
- 🌫️ Haze/Mist
- 🌁 Fog
- ☁️ Cloudy/Overcast

## API Integration

The chart integrates with your existing Flask API endpoints:
- `/api/flight-plan/analyze` - Main route analysis endpoint
- Uses existing weather data structure from METAR/TAF/PIREP sources

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers supporting ES6+
- Chart.js 3.x compatible
- Responsive design works on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Chart Not Displaying
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Chart.js is loaded (check Network tab)
3. Ensure container element exists (`#flightWeatherChart`)

### No Data Showing
1. Verify weather data is being returned from Flask API
2. Check data transformation in `transformDataForFlightChart()`
3. Look for console logs indicating chart creation

### Performance Issues
1. Chart reuses instances to avoid memory leaks
2. Large datasets (>50 points) may impact performance
3. Consider data sampling for very long routes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Animation effects for data updates
- Export chart as image functionality
- Additional weather parameters (pressure, humidity)
- Time-based filtering controls
- Comparison with forecast data
- Integration with flight planning software

## Dependencies

- **Chart.js 3.x** - Main charting library
- **Bootstrap 5** - UI framework (existing)
- **Font Awesome** - Icons (existing)
- **Flask** - Backend framework (existing)
